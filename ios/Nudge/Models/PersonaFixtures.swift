Then the data surprised everyone.\n\nEmpagliflozin nudges your kidneys to pass a little extra sugar — and with it, a little extra sodium and water. That gentle offloading eases the heart's workload and lowers the pressure inside the kidney's tiny filters.\n\nThe result is rare: one daily pill that steadies your sugar, protects a stiff heart, and slows kidney strain at the same time. For a body managing all three, it's the cornerstone — which is why a gap in the refill matters more here than almost anywhere.",
